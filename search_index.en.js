default linker for the 4 ARM Cortex-M targets listed below has changed from\narm-none-eabi-gcc to rust-lld in the latest nightly.\n\nthumbv6m-none-eabi\nthumbv7m-none-eabi\nthumbv7em-none-eabi\nthumbv7em-none-eabihf\n\nThis will break the builds of binaries and cdylibs that were using the\nold default linker (arm-none-eabi-gcc) and additionally pass extra flags to\nthe linker using any of these rustc flags: -C link-arg, -C link-args, -Z pre-link-arg or -Z pre-link-args. Building libraries (rlibs and\nstaticlibs) is not affected by this change.\n\nThis change won't affect stable users when it reaches the 1.30 release because,\nas of 1.28, it's not possible to build binaries or cdylibs for those targets on\nthe stable channel. Building libraries for those targets is possible on stable\nbut it's not affected by this change.\nRationale\nThis breaking change was intentional.\nWe, the embedded WG, wanted to reduce the number of external tools required to\nbuild embedded programs for the ARM Cortex-M architecture. By switching the\ndefault linker to the LLD linker that's shipped with the Rust toolchain the user\nno longer needs to install an ARM linker (like arm-none-eabi-gcc or\narm-none-eabi-ld) to build Rust programs.\nBefore landing this change we first consulted with the community if they\nthought this breaking change was worth it. We received over 20 positive responses\nrepresenting the Cortex-M team (part of the embedded WG), the Tock OS project,\nthe embed-rs organization and independent developers.\nThe consensus was that it was worth to make the default configuration more self\ncontained and that if we were to make the change it had to be made before it\nbecame possible to build binaries on stable otherwise it wouldn't be possible\nto make this change without breaking stable builds.\nHow to fix your build\nIf you are affected by this change you'll observe a linker error with a message\nsimilar to one shown below:\n\n\n\nThere are two ways to fix the problem.\nOption A: switch back to GCC\nThe easiest way is to switch back to using arm-none-eabi-gcc as the linker. To\ndo so pass the flag -C linker=arm-none-eabi-gcc to rustc. In the above example\nyou can do that in the .cargo/config file.\n\n\n\nOption B: tweak the additional linker arguments\nThe other option is to tweak the additional linker arguments so they'll be\naccepted by LLD. In the above example the -nostartfiles flag can be dropped\nbecause that's the default behavior of LLD, and the flags prefixed by -Wl,\nwill have to lose their prefix.\n\n\n\nWith this approach your build will no longer depend on an external linker.\nShould I prefer option A or B?\nIf you are linking to a system installed C library like newlib-arm-none-eabi\nthen you should continue to use GCC. The default library search path of\narm-none-eabi-gcc includes the path to those libraries.\nIf you are not linking to any C code then you should prefer LLD then you won't\nneed to install the arm-none-eabi toolchain.\n","id":"https://blog.rust-embedded.org/2018-08-2x-psa-cortex-m-breakage/","title":"PSA: Cortex-M Breakage (LLD as the default linker)"},"https://blog.rust-embedded.org/embedded-hal-v1/":{"body":"The Rust Embedded Working Group is proud to announce the release of embedded-hal version 1.0 together with the\ncompanion crates embedded-hal-bus, embedded-hal-async and embedded-hal-nb.\nCheck out the repository, the API documentation and the migration guide.\nThe embedded-hal crates provide traits (interfaces) for using peripherals commonly available in microcontrollers\nsuch as GPIO, UART, SPI or I2C. They allow writing drivers (for sensors, displays, actuators, network adapters, etc.) in\na generic way, so they work on any microcontroller with an embedded-hal implementation without\nmodifying them. It's a central piece of the Embedded Rust ecosystem, ensuring interoperability throughout.\nThe 1.0 release has been in the works since 2020. Now that it's out, we consider all\ntraits in it to be stable. The plan is to extend embedded-hal with more traits in future 1.x releases,\nnot doing more breaking changes (i.e. there are no plans for a 2.0 release). This will provide a stable\nbase for building HALs and drivers.\nSo, what's new in embedded-hal 1.0?\n\n\nFerris with a soldering iron by Barnaby Walters.\nFocus on drivers\nPrevious versions of embedded-hal had a dual goal of standardizing HAL APIs for end users, and allowing writing generic drivers.\nExperience has shown that these goals sometimes conflict with each other. As the latter brings much more value, 1.0 focuses on that.\nWe've simplified some traits and merged others to remove interoperability gotchas.\nWe've removed traits that were found to not be usable for generic drivers (most notably timers). The plan is to add\nthem back in the future, with a better design. See the migration guide for details and links to the tracking issues.\nAsync\nA new addition is the embedded-hal-async crate, containing async versions of the traits. With the Rust 1.75 release,\nasync traits are available on Rust stable. They can be used without heap allocations or dynamic\ndispatch (unlike previous macro-based polyfills like the async-trait crate), so they are a great fit for bare-metal embedded usage.\nMost embedded-hal-async traits are async versions of their blocking counterparts.\nHowever, one highlight is the digital::Wait trait, with methods like wait_for_high() and wait_for_low(). This trait adds support for using \"IRQ\" GPIO pins typically used by SPI and I2C devices to send an interrupt to the microcontroller. This frequently-requested feature turned out to be hard to abstract with traits, but is now feasible in an ergonomic way with async.\nSPI bus sharing\n\nThe SpiDevice trait now allows sharing a SPI bus between multiple devices, each selected with its own CS pin. The design allows for unrelated drivers to talk to different devices in the same bus without conflicts and without being aware of each other.\nThe trait is agnostic about the kind of mutex/locking mechanism. The embedded-hal-bus crate provides implementations for commonly used mutexes, but it is possible to write your own for e.g. the mutex of your favourite RTOS.\nError handling\nGeneric drivers can now inspect errors, thanks to them being required to implement an Error trait\nthat allows querying the error \"kind\" out of a pre-selected set. HAL implementations can still use custom error types,\nand map errors that don't fit in these categories to the Other kind.\nAll error types are also required to implement Debug, so .unwrap() and similar are now always available in generic drivers.\nembedded-io\nThe embedded-hal project also hosts the embedded-io crates. They provide traits for byte-oriented I/O streams. Since serial\nports (UART) are essentially byte streams, the serial-specific traits in embedded-hal have been removed in favor of embedded-io.\nembedded-io has not reached 1.0 yet, but we expect that to happen in 2024.\nThanks\nThanks to the HAL team (@therealprof, @ryankurte, @eldruin, @dirbaio, @MabezDev), and to everyone who helped with testing, feedback and contributions for making embedded-hal 1.0 possible.\nThanks to the Rust Foundation for sponsoring Dario Nieuwenhuis (@dirbaio)'s work on embedded-hal through the Fellowship grants program.\nAnd lastly, thanks to all the people releasing and maintaining HAL implementations and drivers using embedded-hal. You are the ones who make embedded-hal actually useful in the real world!\n","id":"https://blog.rust-embedded.org/embedded-hal-v1/","title":"embedded-hal v1.0 now released!"},"https://blog.rust-embedded.org/embedded-rust-in-2019/":{"body":"It's been a busy year for many of the members of the Embedded-WG this year, and we had a chance to catch up at OxidizeConf a few weeks ago. We discussed two main things, Moving off of Mozilla IRC, and our goals for (part of) 2019.\nGoals for 2019\nIn 2018, the Embedded WG pushed hard to get the Cortex-M targets supported as stable targets in the upstream Rust project. Since then, due to work and life responsibilities, a number of us have been particularly busy in 2019.\nAt Oxidize, we discussed what our 2019 goals should be. There were suggestions to get some the foundational level crates like cortex-m, cortex-m-rt, and tools like svd2rust to a \"1.0 state\". However, while there were a number of improvements we could think of, we couldn't draw any clear lines of what it would take for us to be comfortable cutting a 1.0 release of these projects.\nBased on the two points above, we discussed a slightly different plan: Focusing on building out the ecosystem in 2019, by building more \"fun\" stuff, like example projects, cool applications, and extracting and publishing reusable components from these projects to fill in the embedded Rust ecosystem.\nBy focusing on building out, instead of trying to perfect what we already have, we hope to find out the things we don't know we are missing, and inspire other members of the community to begin working and building with Embedded Rust. We'll keep this as a focus through the summer (until September or October 2019). This can be thought of as a parallel to the upstream \"Libs Blitz\" that the Rust project successfully completed in 2017.\nOur weekly meetings will likely relax a bit, and will generally change focus to quickly discuss any high priority issues, then open up to a more informal \"show and tell\", where people can discuss the things they have been building and would like to share. We hope you'll all join us to share the wonderful things you build this summer in embedded Rust!\nMoving off Mozilla IRC\nAt the end of April, Mozilla announced that they would be shutting down irc.mozilla.org. The Rust project as a whole will generally be moving on to other platforms such as Discord and Zulip.\nThe Embedded Working Group is actually one of the few (if not only) working groups that still primarily rely on IRC. We have a few hundred people who idle in the room, and tend to have fairly active discussions there, including our weekly status meetings. We have discussed moving to other platforms previously, but have been unable to get any sort of consensus on what to move to instead. Those discussions lead to a fruitful evaluation of alternatives and led to a pre-selection of suitable services.\nTo move things forward RFC 0351 Chat Vote has been proposed and accepted by the WG which was subsequently implemented by opening voting issue to poll the public opinion on this matter. Anyone with a GitHub account is invited to cast vote(s) until 23:59 CEST on Sunday, 2019-06-23, the detailed rules are explained in the issue and fair discussion is very welcome.\n","id":"https://blog.rust-embedded.org/embedded-rust-in-2019/","title":"Embedded Rust in 2019"},"https://blog.rust-embedded.org/heapless-091/":{"body":"Almost 2 years after the last release, the heapless crate has a new release. The first attempt at a 0.9.0 release was yanked due to including more breaking changes than intended.  This has been fixed, and 0.9.1  has been released today.\nCompared to 0.8.0, the 0.9.1&nbsp;release contains a bunch of small everyday improvements and bugfixes. Most users of the library should be able to adapt with minimal changes. For more information, you can check out the changelog. Here are some of the major changes that can improve your usage of the library.\nThe View types\nOne of the main constraints when working with heapless types is that they all have a const generic. In a lot of situations, these can now be removed thanks to the View types.\nA lot of embedded firmware will allocate a couple of buffers and pass them around to save on memory.\nTo make it easy to change the size of the buffers, functions will carry along these const generics:\n\nThe new View variants of the types enable you to remove the const generics while still keeping the same functionality:\n\nCall sites of handle_request will be able to stay the same. The function will continue to accept &amp;mut Vec&lt;u8, N&gt;.\nSo what's the difference between VecView and Vec?\nThere are almost none, both are aliases of the same underlying type VecInner. The only limitation of  VecView compared to Vec is that VecView is !Sized.&nbsp;This means that you cannot perform anything that would require the compiler to know the size of the VecView at compile-time. You will always need to manipulate VecView through pointer indirection (generally a reference). This means you can't just create a VecView out of thin air. The VecView is always a runtime \"View\" of an existing Vec.\nSo how can we obtain a VecView ?&nbsp;It's pretty simple: Vec can be coerced into a VecView.&nbsp;Coercion (in this case Unsized&nbsp;coercion), is a way the compiler can transform one type into another implicitly. In this case, the compiler is capable of converting pointers to a Vec (&amp;Vec&lt;T, N&gt;, &amp;mut Vec&lt;T, N&gt;, Box&lt;Vec&lt;T, N&gt;&gt; etc...) to pointers to a VecView (&amp;VecView&lt;T&gt;, &amp;mut VecView&lt;T&gt;, Box&lt;VecView&lt;T&gt;&gt; etc...), so you can use a reference to a Vec when a reference to a VecView is expected:\n\nIf you prefer things to be explicit, the View variants of types (Vec&nbsp;is not the only data structure having View variants) can be obtained through vec.as_view() or through vec.as_mut_view().\nThe pointer to the VecView is the size of 2 usize: one for the address of the underlying Vec, and one for the capacity of the underlying Vec.&nbsp;This is exactly like slices. VecView&lt;T&gt; is to Vec&lt;T, N&gt; what a slice [T] is to an array [T;&nbsp;N].\nUnless you need to store data on the stack, most often you will pass around &amp;mut [T] rather than &amp;mut [T; N], because it's simpler. The same applies to VecView.&nbsp;Wherever you use &amp;mut Vec&lt;T, N&gt;, you can instead use &amp;mut VecView&lt;T&gt;.\nThe View types are not available just for Vec. There are View versions of a lot of heapless types:\n\nVec has VecView\nString has StringView\nDeque has DequeView\nLinearMap has LinearMapView\nHistoryBuf has HistoryBufView\nBinaryHeap has BinaryHeapView\nmpmc::Queue has mpmc::QueueView\nspsc::Queue has spsc::QueueView\n(and now, the producer and consumer structs don't carry the const-generic)\nSortedLinkedList has SortedLinkedListView\n\nIndexMap and IndexSet are the two remaining structures that don't have a View type available.\nWe hope to be able to use it in the future.\nBenefits of the view types\nThe benefits are multiple:\nBetter compatibility with dyn Traits\nIf a trait has a function that takes a generic, it is not dyn compatible.&nbsp;By removing the const generic, the View types can make dyn Trait pass around data structures without having to hard-code a single size of buffer in the trait definition.\nBetter binary size and compile times\nWhen you use const-generics, the compiler needs to compile a new version of the function for each value of the const-generic.\nRemoving the const generic means cutting down on duplicated functions that are all almost the same, which improves both compile time and the size of the resulting binary.\nBetter ergonomics\nThe View types can remove a ton of excess noise from the generics.\nThe LenType optimization\nMost often, buffers in embedded applications will not contain a huge number of items.\nUntil 0.9.1&nbsp;the capacity of a heapless data structure was almost always stored as a usize, which can often encode much more values than necessary.\nIn 0.9.1, data structures now have a new optional generic parameter called LenT. This type accepts u8, u16, u32, and usize, and defaults to usize&nbsp;to keep typical uses of the library, simple.\nIf you are seriously constrained by memory, a Vec&lt;T, 28&gt; (equivalent to Vec&lt;T, 28, usize&gt;) can become a Vec&lt;T, 28, u8&gt;, saving up to 7 bytes per Vec. This is not much, but in very small microcontrollers, it can make the difference between a program that uses all the memory available and one that just fits.\nContributors\nThis release was made possible by @Zeenix joining the embedded working group as part of the libs team to help maintain heapless and convincing @sgued to do the same.\nThe View types were a contributions from @sgued, and the LenType were contributed by @GnomedDev.\nIn total 38 contributors participated in all the other improvements to the crate and helped with maintainance.\n","id":"https://blog.rust-embedded.org/heapless-091/","title":"Heapless v0.9.1 has been released!"},"https://blog.rust-embedded.org/newsletter-1/":{"body":"This is the first newsletter of the Embedded WG!

Not With shared-bus!\n\n\nIn most embedded-hal compatible drivers, the driver takes either ownership or a mutable reference to the peripheral used to interact with a component, such as I2C or SPI. For some protocols, such as I2C, which might have multiple devices connected to the same peripheral, managing ownership can be difficult (see embedded-hal/35 for discussion).\nTo address this, @Rahix developed shared-bus, a crate which provides safe shared access to these peripherals through the use of a mutex. This allows for access of the underlying peripheral in as many drivers as you need!

There they had the chance to discuss the needs of the embedded community (as identified in this survey) with the different Rust teams and other WGs. Here's a summary of what was discussed:\n\n\"const generics\"\n\nThe ability to parameterize over values, for example you could use this feature to write a fixed capacity Vec: struct Vec&lt;T, const N: usize&gt; { buffer: [T; N], len: usize }. There are a few compiler refactors going on that are required to land this in nightly so the status is \"WIP\". We'll have future meetings with the compiler team to try to identify and prioritize the parts of the feature that embedded developers need.\n\nconst fn with trait bounds on stable.\n\nFor example, impl&lt;T&gt; Struct&lt;T&gt; where T: Trait { pub const fn new() -&gt; Self { .. } }. A lengthy pre-RFC discussion has concluded and a proper RFC has been proposed.\n\ncore::mem::MaybeUninit on stable.\n\nThe plan is to stabilize a minimal, uncontroversial subset of the API to make this available on stable ASAP.\n\nstd::io in core / alloc.\n\nIt's not possible to move std::io::{Read,Write} into alloc or core because the API depends on OS specific bits (e.g. last_os_error). An option may be to add a new set of Read / Write traits to core, maybe with associated error types, and then try to bridge these to std::io::{Read,Write} using blanket implementations / super traits, but this needs more research.\n\nfix rust-lang/cargo#5730\n\nThis bug breaks no_std builds that use build scripts unless the authors of the build dependencies are aware of the issue and actively work around it. The Cargo team is well aware of the problem. Unfortunately, it's hard to fix and the fix will likely be opt-in because it changes the current semantics.\n\nStabilize RFC 2282 - \"Cargo profile dependencies\"\n\nThis feature lets you optimize dependencies when using the dev profile; useful to keep dev binaries small enough to fit in Flash without sacrificing all debuggability. A new build profile will be added to cover the configuration of proc macros, build scripts, compiler plugins and their dependencies. The new profile solves the remaining unresolved question around RFC 2282.\n\nStabilize core::arch::arm\n\nThis module contains functions for instructions like wfi and nop, and SIMD instructions; stabilizing this removes the pressure for stable inline assembly (asm!). A member of the libs team is interested in this and will help us push it towards the finish line. A PR in this space has recently landed.\n\nAsserts in const fn context become compiler errors.\n\nWe understood that there are still several design / implementation issues that need to be discussed before this is stabilized, but in the meantime you can use the perma-unstable -Z unleash-the-miri-inside-of-you flag to do all sort of stuff in const context.\n\nstd-aware Cargo.\n\n@jamesmunns has written a pre-rfc for an incremental implementation of this feature based on our discussions with people from the libs and Cargo teams and the WASM WG.\n\nImprove searching for no_std crates on crates.io.\n\nThe backend supports searching within a category (like the no_std category) but there's no UI for it right now. This and fixing a bug where searches only return items found until a exact match was found (instead of returning all relevant matches) are in the crates.io team TODO list.\n\nFix: infinite loops (e.g. loop {}) are lowered to an abort instruction.\n\nIdeally, this should be fixed in LLVM proper but it's hard to fix. It's possible to fix this in rustc but the fix is likely to regress the performance of loops. The compiler team will follow up with two unstable flags to evaluate the (performance) impact of fixing this. The first flag applies the fix to only loops in return position of divergent function and the second flag applies the fix to all loops.\n\nMath support in core\n\nThat is 0f32.sin() should \"Just Work\" in no_std crates. There are a few questions about how to best implement this without degrading performance of applications that link to std (we want those to use the arch optimized routines in e.g. glibc's libm instead of the generic Rust implementation) and we need a champion to do the research.\n\nCargo build hooks\n\nThis refers to the ability to run custom code after cargo build. We covered use cases, their requirements and discussed the trade-offs of a more general Cargo tasks (e.g. cargo $task) mechanism vs a more targeted post-build script (e.g. post-build.rs) mechanism. Expect more news (a (pre-)RFC) from the WASM WG on this front.\n\nSlimmer core::fmt.\n\nThe current implementation of core::fmt uses trait objects and function pointers to make all uses of core::fmt fast to compile but this makes core::fmt impossible to inline which makes no_std programs that use formatting large in (binary) size. It might be possible to leverage std-aware Cargo to fix this: we could add a Cargo feature to core to replace the current implementation with one that's fully inlineable but as featureful as the current one -- this should produce smaller binaries.\nFor a bit more of detail you can check the logs and minutes from two meetings ago; they include our notes from the All Hands\nHighlights\n\nThe Embedded WG has started receiving submissions for the embedded showcase!

As Matrix has won by more than 3 votes, it will become the new official chat platform for Rust Embedded! The name of our new channel is #rust-embedded:matrix.org, and you can join it right now using a client like Riot.\nWe will be trialling the new Matrix channel for the next two weeks, using it as our primary and official communication channel. After the trial period, we will evaluate any issues that came up during it, and decide how to proceed. More details about the organization of the channel can be found in the operational notes.\nSince IRC ended in second place, and it's our current platform, we'll also be establishing a bridge between the Matrix channel and IRC during the trial. This way, users have the option to continue using IRC if they so desire.\nTo avoid the administrative overhead of having to switch bridged channels later, we will soon bridge directly to the #rust-embedded channel on Freenode, not to the Mozilla IRC channel. The bridge will be activated once we've worked out the Freenode channel registration.\nWhile Matrix is a federated protocol, we are not planning on running our own infrastructure for now - instead, we will be using the matrix.org IRC bridge, and users are free to register on matrix.org or any other homeserver of their choosing. If this turns out to be a problem during the trial period, we may reconsider this decision.\nWe're also looking into a static log viewer, that would allow us to publish search-engine-indexable channel logs for public reading, similar to the public logs that we currently have. This may require us to self-host a static log generator such as matrix-static. Suggestions for other solutions are welcome!\nHighlights\n\n\nWe've had a bunch of Embedded Rust related events over the past couple of months. EWG member @thejpster was at ACCU 2019 (the Association of C and C++ Users Annual Conference), in Bristol, UK, on 12 April, delivering a talk on Embeddded Rust and the Monotron. Jonathan was then speaking at the Centre for Computing History in Cambridge, UK on 18 April, followed by hosting Oxidize at the end of April! Next up, Monotron is visiting Rust Conf in Portland, USA in late August.

Some members of the embedded WG were present and we had a chance to talk to the compiler, core and infra teams.\nThese are the highlights of our talks.\nEmbedded Rust on stable\nWe had previously identified 3 unstable features / issues that tie embedded development to the nightly channel in https://github.com/japaric/stable-embedded-rust. We talked to the other Rust teams about the possibility of addressing these issues in time for the 2018 edition release and the conclusion was that they thought that the timeline was possible. These are the 3 unstable features we are referring to:\nUnstable Feature #1: xargo\nWe'll ship a rust-std component (pre-compiled core+compiler-builtins) for the thumb* and msp430 targets. This removes the need for xargo so people will be able to do something like the following to cross compile to ARM Cortex-M:\n\nTracking issue: rust-lang/rust#49382.\nUnstable Feature #2: compiler-builtins\nextern crate compiler_builtins is unstable to directly use. The fix we have decided on is to inject that as part of the prelude you get from #![no_std].\nSo, today #![no_std] expands to something like this:\n\nWith our change the expansion will run like this:\n\nIn the future we might want to merge compiler-builtins into core but that requires more effort and can still be done if we do the #![no_std] prelude approach right now.\nTracking issue: rust-lang/rust#49380\nUnstable Feature #3: panic_fmt\nThere's an accepted RFC (#2070) for a stable mechanism to select the behavior of panic! in no_std context, and there's a know issue where the arguments of panic_fmt are kept in the binary even when they are unused by the panic_fmt implementation (cf. rust-lang/embedded-wg#41).\nThe main concern here was whether we'll be able to fix the binary size problem with the accepted design or if we'll need some new design. The compiler team thinks that this can be fixed with the existing design using MIR only rlibs but it's unlikely this will get fixed in time for the edition release. nagisa will likely propose an alternate solution that involves having Cargo select the panic provider crate.\nNon critical unstable features\nThere are some other unstable features that don't prevent you from doing embedded development, however they come up often when doing no-std development. We had a chat with people on the compiler team about them.\nUnstable Feature #4: const fn\nThis feature has been proposed for stabilization (cf. rust-lang/rust#24111).\nUnstable Feature #5: asm!\nBackground: Some assembly operations can be implemented as external assembly files that are then called into using FFI; other ops though do need to be inlined into the function from which they are called to prevent losing semantics. Using external assembly file can be done on the stable channel. The second type of operation requires the unstable asm! macro.\nThe compiler team is not 100% sure on whether they want to stabilize inline assembly for the edition release. The embedded WG has proposed an alternative proposal: expose some assembly operations that need to be inlined as \"Rust intrinsics\" -- in a similar fashion to how SIMD is being implemented; these intrinsics would be in the core::asm::$ARCH module and they could either be implemented by lowering to a LLVM intrinsic or using inline assembly. For example:\n\nThese would be stable APIs with an unstable implementation. If LLVM assembler syntax changes, the implementations of these functions would have to be updated.\nThe embedded WG will submit an RFC proposing the asm module and that will include a list of assembly operations that (a) are common and (b) need to be inlined for different architectures.\nUnstable Feature #6: #[used]\nThis experimental feature has been in the compiler for a while and it's required in some scenarios when using LTO to prevent the compiler from dead-stripping some function / static that needs to be in the final binary.\nWe'll try to get it stabilized by the edition release but it's not a high priority feature.\nStability of the Embedded Targets\nWe don't only want to make embedded Rust possible on stable; we also want to make sure the embedded targets don't regress. So we are going to add tests to rust-lang/rust CI to make sure regression block PRs from landing.\nThat effectively will make some of the embedded targets into the tier 1 platform. The core team is fine with adding the thumb* targets (ARM Cortex-M) to tier 1. Less maintained, still in development and not fully mature targets like AVR, MSP430 and RISCV will become tier 2 -- they'll be tested but won't block PRs and rust-std binaries will be produced but it's not guaranteed there will be binaries available for all nightly / beta / stable releases.\nWe'll open an issue to discuss with the infra team the exact tests we want to add and track progress on that, but have already told them about the kind of tests we want to add and they thought those kind of tests are possible to implement. The kind of tests we discussed were:\n\nIt compiles and links\nRuns the cross compiled binary in QEMU doesn't crash and exits with exit code 0.\nTracking the binary size of a program compiled with -Os / -Oz and notify someone or fail the build if the size changes by +/- 5-10% or something.\n\nLLVM backends that are not yet in rustc\nThere are two embedded LLVM backends that have not yet been enabled in rustc for different reasons: AVR and RISCV.\nIn the case of AVR the main reason is that some LLVM codegen bugs prevent you from building core for AVR. These bugs are related to 128-bit integers and formatting floats. The libs team discussed this some time ago and they decided they are fine with landing arch specific #[cfg] attributes to remove 128-bit integers and other things like float APIs.\nIn the case of RISCV the LLVM backend is currently under active development and our current version of LLVM doesn't fully support RISCV. We would have to backport several patches to make RISCV work on our LLVM version. The core team feels OK with backporting those patches as long as they have already landed in upstream LLVM, and are not still under review.\nTooling\nGetting tooling for e.g. binary inspection (e.g. objdump) can be hard on some platforms (e.g. Windows) specially for architecture which currently are not too widely used (e.g. RISCV). We can improve the situation here by shipping llvm tools with the Rust toolchain -- with one set of those tools you can inspect all the architectures that Rust supports. These are the thoughts of the core / infra team regarding this:\n\nWe put these tools in the sysroot and have them always shipped with the Rust toolchain so no rustup component add required -- this is already the case with lld. It might not be possible to provide these tools on all platforms but it's very likely they'll be available on tier 1 platforms.\nWe do not add these tools to the user $PATH. Instead some Cargo subcommand will be created by the embedded WG (e.g. cargo objdump) and that subcommand will look for llvm-objdump in the  sysroot and do the right thing.\nWe make no guarantees about the semantics and interface of these tools being preserved over time (e.g. CLI changes, user facing output format changes, etc.).\n\nThe Embedded Rust Book\nWe decided on an initial audience for the embedded book; we will be targeting people that know some embedded stuff and some Rust. The main reason for this is that if someone knows one and not the\nother then they can go and read existing Rust documentation or the Discovery book and then read the embedded book.

There is just a single unstable feature that prevents\nus from building a no_std binary on stable: the panic_fmt lang item. This unstable feature will\nsoon be removed in favor of the #[panic_implementation] feature (implementation PR), which is\nslated for stabilization in time for the edition release (we are hoping to stabilize it as early as\n1.28 but we'll see).\nMaking the Cortex-M ecosystem work on stable\n\"no_std binaries are possible on stable\" is very different from \"my embedded application\nbuilds on stable\". The later requires all the dependencies to also compile on stable. So we are\nstarting to migrate the Cortex-M ecosystem to work on stable. All the crates listed below are now\ncompiling on the beta channel.\nLegend: crate-name - link to CHANGELOG - link to stabilization PR - removed unstable features\n\ncortex-m-quickstart - CHANGELOG - PR\n\n\ncortex-m-rt - CHANGELOG - PR - asm! core_intrinsics global_asm!\nlang_items linkage naked_functions used\n\n\ncortex-m-semihosting - CHANGELOG - PR\n\n\ncortex-m - CHANGELOG - PR - asm! const_fn\n\n\nembedded-hal - CHANGELOG - PR - never_type\n\n\nf3 - CHANGELOG - PR\n\n\nl3gd20 - CHANGELOG - PR - Unsized\n\n\nlsm303dlhc - CHANGELOG - PR - Unsized\n\n\nstm32f103xx - CHANGELOG - PR - const_fn global_asm! try_from\nuse_extern_macros used\n\n\nstm32f30x-hal - CHANGELOG - PR - never_type\n\n\nstm32f30x - CHANGELOG - PR - const_fn global_asm! try_from\nuse_extern_macros used\n\n\nsvd2rust (output of) - CHANGELOG - PR - const_fn global_asm!\ntry_from use_extern_macros used\n\nThere's a lot of breaking changes there but the most visible one is cortex-m-rt because it changes\nhow applications are structured. Check the cortex-m-quickstart template for instructions on\nhow to set up an embedded application using the latest versions of everything.\nThere are still a lot of crates that will need to be updated to work on beta. Among the more general\npurpose ones we have heapless and cortex-m-rtfm, which needs to be update to work with\ncortex-m-rt v0.5.0.\nHow you can help us\nTry to compile your Cortex-M crate using the beta channel! If your crate is an application the build\nwill certainly fail, but check if all the dependencies, excluding the panic handler crate,\ncompile on beta. If any dependency doesn't compile on the beta channel let the author know, but\nfirst check if there's a new version of the crate that already compiles on the beta channel. And if\nyou feel up to the task you could even send a PR to the dependency to make it compile on beta -- the\nlist of stabilization PRs in the previous section may give you a clue on how to move the crate to\nbeta.\nIf you are the author of a Cortex-M device crate, a crate generated using svd2rust, moving it to\nstable only requires regenerating it using svd2rust v0.13.0. Do note that the generation process\nhas changed for the Cortex-M target; also make sure you bump the minor version when you publish a\nnew version.\nIf you are the author of a driver crate or a HAL implementation, please update your crate to use\nv0.2.0 of embedded-hal and test that it builds on beta. Make sure you bump the minor version when\nyou publish a new version of your crate -- bumping the version of the embedded-hal dependency is a\nbreaking change (drivers that depend on embedded-hal v0.1.0 can't be used with HAL implementation\ncrates that depend on embedded-hal v0.2.0).\nIf you are porting an application to the newest cortex-m-* crates you may hit these errors:\n\n\"error: requires start lang_item\" on binary crates. You need to switch from the standard main\ninterface to #![no_main] + entry!. Use the examples in the quickstart template as a\nreference.\n\n\n\"error[E0015]: calls in statics are limited to constant functions, tuple structs and tuple\nvariants\". const fn is not a stable feature so it's not used in the API by default. The\ncortex-m provides a \"const-fn\" feature to opt into this unstable feature and expose const\nfunctions in the API; other dependencies should / probably provide a similar feature.\n\nWhat does this all mean for you?\nTo those of you who have been doing embedded development on nightly: things will get much easier\nfrom now on. We have reduced the number of unstable features in core crates of the Cortex-M\necosystem to zero. Although you will have to continue to use nightly for application development\nyou can expect zero breakage from these crates when updating the nightly compiler. There is one\nexpected breakage coming soon though: panic_fmt will be removed as announced above. This will\nbreak the panic handler crates; however, the breakage will be isolated to those crates and\nthe fix will consist of simply updating the dependency version.\nTo those of you who have been meaning to dive into embedded Rust development: we'll soon be done\nwith our \"embedded Rust on stable\" tasks and we'll move our focus to documenting the embedded\ndevelopment process, tooling and ecosystem. The embedded Rust book will become the resource\nto get started on embedded Rust, but it doesn't quite exist right now.\nWhat about architectures other than ARM Cortex-M?\nThe path carved for ARM Cortex-M can be followed by the other architectures (ARM Cortex-R, AVR,\nMSP430, RISCV, etc.). Each architecture presents its own extra set of challenges though:\n\n\nMSP430 being the second oldest embedded / no_std target is the closest one to make it to stable\n(as a tier 2 target) by the edition release. The main blocker is that extern \"msp430-interrupt\"\nis not available on stable but I think that may be possible to work around using external C /\nassembly files + FFI.\n\n\nBoth AVR and RISCV are blocked from being included in the Rust compiler due to either the\nimmaturity of the LLVM backend or LLVM backend bugs. Not many (embedded) Rust developers can also\nhack LLVM backends so we are short handed on the AVR front; OTOH, the RISCV is being actively\ndeveloped by third parties so it's probably just a matter of time before we add it to rustc.\n\n\nARM Cortex-R LLVM backend is probably in good shape due to the similarities between its\ninstruction set and the ARM Cortex-M instruction set, so adding the target to the compiler should\nbe straightforward. However, the crate ecosystem is nonexistent at this point so there's a lot of\nwork to be done on that front.\n\n\n\nThis work is part of the embedded WG effort towards making embedded development possible on\nthe stable channel. (We are almost done! :tada:)\n","id":"https://blog.rust-embedded.org/the-path-towards-stable/","title":"The Path Towards Stable"},"https://blog.rust-embedded.org/this-year-in-embedded-rust-2021/":{"body":"As 2021 draws to a close, we thought we'd take a look back at what's happened\nover the last year in Embedded Rust, both within the working group and in the\nlarger community.\nMeetings\nWe continued our weekly Rust Embedded Working Group meetings on our Matrix channel.

As we approach the date of the 2018\nedition release we reflect on our progress and share our achievements with you\nin this post.\nDiscuss on users.rust-lang.org, on twitter, or on reddit!\nEmbedded Rust on stable\nStability -- AKA \"my crate should not break when moving to a newer toolchain\" --\nwas the single most requested feature by the embedded community during the 2018\nroadmap planning phase.\nEmbedded development has been tied to the nightly\nchannel since its very beginning, and the people that have been doing embedded\ndevelopment for a while have endured many breaking changes. Thankfully, those\ndays are over: Rust 1.30 marks the first stable release where you can build\nfully working embedded programs without relying on unstable features.\nFurthermore, we now have some unit tests that check embedded code in the\ncompiler test suite so unintentional breakage will be caught before it makes its\nway into the nightly channel.\nA smooth starting point\n\"How do I get started with embedded Rust?\" has been a common question on IRC for\na long time. It has not been an easy question to answer, though: maintaining\ndocumentation that relies on unstable features for a long period of time has\nbeen an uphill battle so newcomers have often run into outdated docs.\nBut now that stable embedded Rust is here we have put together an authoritative\nresource for getting started with embedded Rust: The Embedded Rust Book. We\nhave put a lot of effort in making the first experience as frictionless as\npossible with the help of templates and tooling.\nThe embedded Rust book is not just a getting started guide; it's also meant\nto be the document that teaches you how to effectively use the language to write\ncorrect embedded software. We are currently amassing all our hard earned\nexperience into patterns and tips that we are adding to this book.\nResources for everyone\nThe Embedded Rust Book is aimed at people that have some experience with\nembedded development, but we recognize that Rust has great potential for\nbecoming people's first choice for getting their feet wet with embedded\ndevelopment so we have updated and will continue to work on resources, like the\nDiscovery book, that are aimed at that demographic.\nWe also recognize that the target audience for embedded Rust has different\nlevels of expertise with embedded systems and a varied set of interests\nso we are also building advances resources like the embedonomicon\nand collecting more targeted resources, like crates, in the\nawesome-embedded-rust list. You can find these and other of our resources in\nour docs webpage.\nAn organized community effort\nAll this has been accomplished with the hard work of many volunteers, both WG\nmembers and other community members. The WG members, in particular, are\ncommitted to maintaining the core crates and documentation that the\necosystem relies on. All these resources have been taken under the umbrella of\nthe rust-embedded organization.\nWG teams\nThe embedded space is huge: there are several architectures used in\nthis space, many application areas, and embedded developers work with different\nsets of constraints: real-time constraints, memory constraints, energy / power\nconstraints, etc.\nFor this reason we have been creating and growing specialized teams within the\nWG by adding members with different areas of expertise. This ensures that we\nhave different perspectives when making API design decisions in core crates and\nwhen communicating the needs of the embedded community to the other Rust teams.\nHaving specialized teams also means that the crates developed by the org can be\nassigned to the people with the right technical background.\nOn the upcoming 2018 edition\nIn this last sprint towards the 2018 edition we are focusing our efforts in\nour documentation!\nYou can help us by proofreading our docs, reporting errors, giving feedback on\nthe existing content, requesting new topics and writing about topics that have\nnot yet been covered. Every little bit of help is greatly appreciated!\nOne important note: our documentation makes use of the 2018 edition which\nrequires you to use the beta channel until 1.31 is released in early December.\nWe suggest that you use the beta channel until then to get the best experience.\nBeyond 2018\nOur work doesn't stop the day Rust 1.31 comes out; the 2018 edition is just the\nstarting line of embedded Rust. As we continue to learn how to effectively use\nRust for embedded development we'll continue to refine and expand our\ndocumentation as well as the core crates we maintain and develop.\nAlso, at this point in time ARM Cortex-M is our most mature target architecture\nand the majority of crates on crates.io target this architecture, but we have\nlaid the groundwork for supporting other targets like bare metal ARM Cortex-A,\nARM Cortex-R, MSP430 and RISCV. We'll continue to work on getting these\ntargets on parity with the ARM Cortex-M target during the next year.\nFinally, we'd love to hear what you would like to see happen in the embedded\nspace in 2019. We are collecting a \"wishlist\" of things the embedded community\nwould like to see get done, fixed and / or stabilized in 2019. Need some API in\ncore to be stabilized? Would like to get some Cargo bug / papercut fixed? Let us\nknow and we'll look into making it happen! We'll use this data to set out an\nembedded Rust roadmap for 2019.\nHere's to a 2019 with more embedded Rust success stories (yes, \"more\"; wait\nfor the upcoming revamped rust-lang website ;-)).
