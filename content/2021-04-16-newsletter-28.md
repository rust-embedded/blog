- Crate [device-driver] has released version 0.2.0!  
(Since 0.1.0, added customizable bit ordering and more pac-like write and modify interface)
- After almost a year [stm32f4xx-hal] has released version 0.9.0! Get it while it's hot. 🔥🌶️
- [embedded-graphics 0.7.0-beta.1 released] as the first stable step towards the long awaited 0.7.0! 
  There should be no major/breaking changes after this release as we work mostly on documentation, bugfixes and polish. See the release notes [here](https://github.com/embedded-graphics/embedded-graphics/releases/tag/embedded-graphics-v0.7.0-beta.1).
- [svd2rust 0.18.0] was released, bringing a number of changes to PAC
  generation; if you maintain a PAC please try it out!
- [shared-bus 0.2.1] was released, with support for concurrency frameworks like RTIC.  Check the [relevant documentation](https://docs.rs/shared-bus/latest/shared_bus/type.BusManagerAtomicCheck.html) for more details.
