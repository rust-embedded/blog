As 2021 draws to a close, we thought we'd take a look back at what's happened
over the last year in Embedded Rust, both within the working group and in the
larger community.

## Meetings

We continued our weekly Rust Embedded Working Group meetings on [our Matrix channel][#rust-embedded:matrix.org]. They take place at 8pm Berlin time every Tuesday, and are open to the public. You can find all the [minutes on Github].

## Newsletters

The [blog] saw five new newsletters posted, keeping everyone up to date with what's hot in Embedded Rust. Make sure you bookmark or subscribe with your favourite RSS reader so you never miss an update! Please do also keep your contributions coming, as we love hearing about what everyone gets up to in Embedded Rust outside of the official Rust Embedded Working Group projects.

## Platform Support

Outside of the working group, platform support communities provide vendor-specific support for particular microcontrollers and development boards.

2021 saw a brand-new microcontroller vendor hit the scene - Raspberry Pi! Their debut RP2040 microcontroller has two Cortex-M0 cores, and certainly made us all think about how we can try to make our software safe to use on multi-core systems. A new [rp-rs] community sprang up and continues to make good progress supporting all areas of the RP2040 with good quality examples.

This year also saw Espressif officially adopt Rust and [they hired @mabez] from the [esp-rs] community to help out!

Other platform support communities continued to develop this year:

* [atsamd-rs](https://github.com/atsamd-rs) for Atmel ARM SAM-D and SAM-E microcontrollers ([Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#atsamd-rs_community:gitter.im))
* [avr-rust](https://github.com/avr-rust) for Atmel AVR microcontrollers ([Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#avr-rust_Lobby:gitter.im))
* [esp-rs](https://github.com/esp-rs) for Espressif ESP8266 and ESP32 Wi-Fi chips ([Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#esp-rs:matrix.org))

* [lpc55](https://github.com/lpc55) for NXP ARM LPC55xx microcontrollers ([Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#lpc55:matrix.org))
* [nrf-rs](https://github.com/nrf-rs) for Nordic ARM nRF51, 52 and 9160 Bluetooth/LTE devices ([Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#nrf-rs:matrix.org))
* [riscv-rust](https://github.com/riscv-rust) for all kinds of RISC-V devices
* [rp-rs](https://github.com/rp-rs) for Raspberry Pi's RP2040 microcontroller ([Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#rp-rs:matrix.org))
* [stm32-rs](https://github.com/stm32-rs) for all of ST Micro's 32-bit ARM microcontrollers ([Matrix chat](https://matrix.to/#/#stm32-rs:matrix.org))

If you're a platform support community not on the list please get in touch, we'd love to hear from you!

## Other Embedded Projects

While not officially part of the Embedded Working Group, the following projects all continued to develop over 2021:

* The concurrency framework [RTIC](https://rtic.rs) ([GitHub](https://github.com/rtic-rs), [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#rtic:matrix.org)) hit version 1.0!
* The async framework [Embassy](https://embassy.dev) ([GitHub](https://github.com/embassy-rs), [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#embassy-rs:matrix.org)) has been under heavy development and now supports STM32, nRF and RP2040 platforms.
* The debug and programming library and tools from [probe-rs](https://probe.rs) ([GitHub](https://github.com/probe-rs), [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#probe-rs:matrix.org)) released v0.11 and v0.12 of their library and tools including [cargo-embed](https://github.com/probe-rs/cargo-embed).
* The [Knurling](https://knurling.ferrous-systems.com/) project ([GitHub](https://github.com/knurling-rs)) has had several releases of their tools such as [probe-run](https://github.com/knurling-rs/probe-run).
* The [smoltcp](https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp) embedded TCP/IP stack released v0.7 and v0.8, with many improvements including to the DHCP client and adding IEEE 802.15.4 support.
* [embedded-graphics](https://github.com/embedded-graphics) ([Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#rust-embedded-graphics:matrix.org)), a graphics library for embedded applications, had a major new v0.7 release (see the [migration notes](https://github.com/embedded-graphics/embedded-graphics/blob/master/MIGRATING-0.6-0.7.md)).
* The [Hubris](https://oxidecomputer.github.io/hubris/) RTOS and its companion debugger Humility, by [Oxide Computer](https://oxide.computer/), had their first release.

## Our Repositories
