## Highlights

* The `min_const_fn` feature [has landed], allowing for stable use of `const fn` functions in an embedded context in the upcoming 1.31 release of Rust!
* [Frank Pagliughi] has kicked off [`rust-industrial-io`], a crate providing an interface to `libiio` on linux, which is used for communication with industrial sensors and actuators
* [gregokent] has started development on [`cortex-r-rt`], a runtime crate for Cortex-R processors
* The HAL Impl crate for the Texas Instruments TM4C123 now [works on 1.30-beta]! **Now is a great time to ensure that your embedded crates will work flawlessly with the 2018 Edition of Rust!**

## Embedded Projects

If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to mention it on the tracking issue for [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!

* [e-matteson] has released their [`keypad` driver], which can be used with keypad matrix circuits. Check out more [details on reddit]
* [Daniel Gallagher] has recently released two handy Bluetooth crates in an [intro blog] post:
    * [`bluenrg`], an embedded-hal crate used to interface with STMicro's series of microcontrollers
    * [Bluetooth HCI], a helper crate for interfacing with the Bluetooth Host-Controller interface
