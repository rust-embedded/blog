## Highlights

<!-- TODO Add news related to embedded Rust that are not about new crates releases here -->

- [@andre-richter] added a new tutorial for the `Operating System development tutorials in Rust on the Raspberry Pi` series:
    - Tutorial 13: [Integrated Testing](https://github.com/rust-embedded/rust-raspi3-OS-tutorials/tree/master/13_integrated_testing) - Kernel `Unit tests`, `Integration tests` and `Console tests` using `QEMU`. 

- TODO(remove, this is an example) the Rust compiler has gained cross compilation support for the Xtensa architecture!

## Embedded Projects

- [@andre-richter] released v0.1.0 of [`qemu-exit`]. This library provides functions to gracefully exit a running QEMU session from within your Rust binary with an user-defined exit code. This can be used for unit or integration tests that run inside QEMU. Currently supports `aarch64` and `x86_64` architectures.

- [@eldruin] released a platform-agnostic [driver for the Si4703][si4703-driver] FM radio turner (receiver) and published a [blog post][si4703-blog-post] including a picture of an example setup.

- [@eldruin] released a platform-agnostic [driver for the PCA9685][pca9685-driver] PWM LED/Servo controller driver and published a [blog post][pca9685-blog-post] including a video of the device controlling RGB LEDs and several Servo motors simultaneously.

- [@eldruin] released a platform-agnostic [driver for Vishay's VEML6030 and VEML7700][veml6030-driver] ambient light sensors and published a [blog post][veml6030-blog-post] about it.

- [@nickray] released `salty` ([API][salty-api], [book][salty-book], [code][salty-code]), a library for fast Ed25519 signatures on Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M33 microcontrollers. It presents the `ed25519-dalek` API, but is self-contained and uses the fastest currently published field operations implementation, due to Bjoern Haase, based on the `UMAAL` DSP instruction `(a: u32, b: u32, c: u32, d: u32) -> (a * b + c + d): u64`. Testing is done on the `musca-b1` Cortex-M33 microcontroller, simulated in QEMU v4. Additionally, a C API is included.

- [@nickray] released `littlefs2` ([API][littlefs2-api], [code][littlefs2-code]), an idiomatic Rust API for the [`littlefs`][littlefs-upstream] filesystem for microcontrollers, modeled after `std::fs`. The upstream library claims to be resilient against power-loss, and supports features like dynamic wear-leveling with bad block detection, inline files for efficient use of storage, and custom user attributes on files and directories.

- [@nickray] released `nisty` ([API][nisty-api], [code][nisty-code]), a companion library to `salty` with similar API, but for NIST P-256 signatures on Cortex-M4 and Cortex-M33 microcontrollers. It offers deterministic signatures, idiomatic conversions, and uses [`micro-ecc`][micro-ecc] as backend implementation, which also has `UMAAL` DSP instruction optimizations.
