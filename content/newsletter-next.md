If you have an embedded project or blog post you would like to have featured in the Embedded WG Newsletter, make sure to add it to [the next newsletter], we would love to show it off!

- TODO(remove, this is an example) Crate embedded-foo has released version 1.0.0!
- [svd2rust](https://crates.io/crates/svd2rust) released v0.20.0.
- The new version of the [Discovery book](https://docs.rust-embedded.org/discovery)
  targeting the micro:bit development board was released.
- [embedded-hal] 1.0.0-alpha.6 and 1.0.0-alpha.7 released, with a number of new features and
    changes as we work towards the final 1.0 release. Most notably,
    CAN (Controller Area Network) traits were added and some traits
    with unconstrained associated types were removed.
- [embedded-hal] 0.2.7 released, including CAN (Controller Area Network) traits which were backported.
- [embedded-dma] 0.2.0 released, including const generics support and resolves some confusion around `'static`.
- A project to develop asynchronous versions of the `embedded-hal` traits has been started.
  See the current [roadmap](https://github.com/rust-embedded/embedded-hal/issues/356) and please join the effort!
- [linux-embedded-hal] 0.4.0-alpha.2 released updating `embedded-hal` to version 1.0.0-alpha.7.
- New Rust Embedded ecosystem for the radiation-hardened Vorago VA108xx family of devices:
    [va108xx](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/va108xx) PAC,
    [va108xx-hal](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/va108xx-hal) HAL
    and [vorago-reb1](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/vorago-reb1) BSP
    with [blogpost](https://robamu.github.io/post/rust-ecosystem/)
- New [device driver crate](https://egit.irs.uni-stuttgart.de/rust/max116xx-10bit) for the MAX116xx
    10-bit ADC devices with [blogpost](https://robamu.github.io/post/max11619-driver-rust/)
- The RIOT operating system now [has upstream support for Rust applications](https://doc.riot-os.org/using-rust.html).

  This encompasses support in the build system,
  high-level [wrappers](https://crates.io/crates/riot-wrappers) that make the OS's C mechanisms safe and idiomatic to use,
  and [additional examples](https://gitlab.com/etonomy/riot-examples) maintained externally.
  The wrappers implement high-level traits (e.g. from [embedded-hal](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-hal), [embedded-nal](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-nal) and [mutex-traits](https://crates.io/crates/mutex-traits)) where practical.
- A [blog post by Tweede Golf](https://tweedegolf.nl/en/blog/65/async-rust-vs-rtos-showdown) about comparing Embassy with FreeRTOS.
- [eeprom24x] I2C EEPROM driver 0.5.0 released, adding support for STM M24C01 and M24C02 devices as well as implementing the [`embedded-storage`](https://github.com/rust-embedded-community/embedded-storage) traits.
- [measurements] 0.10.4 and 0.11.0 released, most notably adding support for humidity and density.
- [9names] released a platform-agnostic [driver for Wii Extension Controllers][wii-ext] and published a [blog post][wii-ext-post]. This driver supports Nunchuk controllers as well as the many variants of the Classic Controller (Original/Pro/NES/SNES).
- Drogue Device now features an [async Bluetooth Mesh stack](https://blog.drogue.io/bluetooth-mesh/).
